Windows Form: Student Management System

Requirements: 
Belgium campus (BC) has recently opened a campus at Stellenbosch. BC has hired you to be its lead software developer. The campus seeks to have a student management system which will be able to register and display all students that are on the satellite campus on demand by management. The new campus is running a registration promotion for any student who will register and be above 25 years of age. If the student is female, they will get a 30% discount on their total fees and if male they will receive a 19% discount. The fee for Degree is R85000 whilst for Diploma is R45000 respectively.

The developed system can store the following information when a student is registering:

•	Student ID 

•	Student Name

•	Surname

•	Gender

•	Email address

•	DOB

•	Phone number

•	Qualification (Degree or Diploma) 

The system has been designed and built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to provide a modular, extensible, and scalable architecture. Furthermore,  the system can display any form of notification if the student gets the promotion listed above and details of all registered students.
